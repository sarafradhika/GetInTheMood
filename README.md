# GetInTheMood
This is a course project that uses conditional random fields to perform natural language processing (labeling sequential data) for a song sorting application.

Feel free to download the lyrics of your favorite song as .htm file and make the relevant changes in the code (Project.ipynb) to see how it is classified!

Please see PGM_report.pdf for references.
